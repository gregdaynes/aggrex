Documentation for choices made when developing Aggrex are done through ADRs. These are for recording the reason behind a choice for future developers (even you) to understand why something was done the way it is. These are not permanent choices, and a proposal to change a decision can be made the same way.

Code choices, eg: how to add 1 and 1, do not need to be captured in an ADR.

To create a new ADR use the following command (replace `[my-new-adr-name]` with your proposal name - use hyphens to separate words), then edit the new file in your editor.

```
npm run adr [my-new-adr-name]
```
